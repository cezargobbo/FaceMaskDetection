# Face Mask Detection and Classification
#### Universidade Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo - January 2022

In this project you are able to detect faces and classify them by wearing masks or not, using a webcam or video as input. Also, the algorithm will calculate in real time the COVID-19 contamination risk, based on the number of unmasked faces.

To train the YOLOv4, we built our own dataset gathering images from TV reports made on the streets and from cameras installed in challenging real-world places, where there are many people walking around wearing and not wearing masks with different types of characteristics, such as skin color, lighting variation, faces partially obstructed, and also faces far away from the camera source. We named this new dataset as WildCam, and along with other datasets of faces that we found on the internet, we put together a very robust and diversified database of images. The purpose of this project is to help with the rules stipulated by the World Health Organization. The dataset is free and available at the link below.

OpenCV 3.4.0 Installation
```sh
mkdir ~/libraries
cd ~/libraries
mkdir opencv3.4.0 && cd opencv3.4.0
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
cd opencv_contrib
git checkout 3.4.0
cd ../opencv

Darknet 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet
cd darknet
git checkout darknet_yolo_v4_pre
```
Edit `Makefile` replacing lines below ("-" means remove, "+" means add)
```sh
-GPU=0
+GPU=1
-CUDNN=0
+CUDNN=1
-OPENCV=0
+OPENCV=1
-LIBSO=0
+LIBSO=1
-NVCC=nvcc
+NVCC=/usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin/nvcc
-LDFLAGS+= `pkg-config --libs opencv4 2> /dev/null || pkg-config --libs opencv`
-COMMON+= `pkg-config --cflags opencv4 2> /dev/null || pkg-config --cflags opencv`
+LDFLAGS+= `pkg-config --libs opencv3 2> /dev/null || pkg-config --libs opencv`
+COMMON+= `pkg-config --cflags opencv3 2> /dev/null || pkg-config --cflags opencv`
-COMMON+= -DGPU -I/usr/local/cuda/include/
+COMMON+= -DGPU -I/usr/local/cuda-10.1/include/
```

After edit and save, you must build the darknet with the command:
```sh
make
```
After compilling, a `libdarknet.so` file will be generated in the darknet root folder. 

Now go the Mask Detection project root folder and create a directory named `lib/`, then move the `libdarknet.so` into the `lib/`.
#
##### Building Project

Download the network models at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pvdUjThZJQUqpd5tNPwdE-LX2v7N45FH/view?usp=sharing.
Save them and extract at repository root level, generating a folder called `net_models` automatically.

```sh
cd FaceMaskDetection
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -D CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-10.1 ..
make
```
#
##### Usage
```sh
Usage: ./mask_detection [--camera CAMERA] [--file FILE] [--path PATH] [--threshold THRESHOLD] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT] [--detection-off]
```
`[--camera CAMERA]` means any camera attached to the PC, just pass as an argument using `-c`. Example:
```
./mask_detection -c 0
```
`[--file FILE]` means if you have any video file to run, just pass as an argument using `-f`. Example
```
./mask_detection -f video.mp4
```
`[--path PATH]` means if you have a folder containing many videos, just pass the folder path as an argument using `-p`. Example:
```
./mask_detection -p /path/to/videos/
```
`[--threshold THRESHOLD]` is used to set the detection probability threshold of the mask recognition, if the threshold is closed to 0 means you are putting the confidence more in the YoLo network, otherwise, if the threshold is closed to 1, you are setting a lower bound to the network accuracy. To use this threshold just pass as an argument using `-t`. Example:
```
./mask_detection -p /path/to/videos/ -t 0.25
```
`[--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]` means the width and the height of the cam or video you are passing as an argument. To set it, just pass the values as arguments using `-w` and `-h`. It's highly recommended to used low values depending on your machine. If you have a high end machine its okay to set FullHD or HD, otherwise you can try (640,360) Example:
```
./mask_detection -p /path/to/videos/ -w 640 -h 360
```
`[--detection-off]` is used to disable the mask detection, in case you want to. To use this argument just pass the sentence as it is. Example:
```
./mask_detection -p /path/to/videos/ --detection-off
```
